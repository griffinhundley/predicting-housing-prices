    "When listing a house for sale, it is important to price it accurately. Houses that are priced too high can sit on the market for months, which can lead to the price eventually being dropped to generate sales. According to a study from Zillow, in the Seattle area, a house that is on the market for 2 months will lead to a 5% drop in price. On the other side, if a house is priced too low, a seller is not maximizing the return on their house. In both of these cases, the seller is not getting as much money as they can and the realtor is not maximizing their comission for the sale, as commission is tied to selling price. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this, we are creating a model to estimate the price of a home based on certain characterisitics of the house. This will allow realtors to more accurately price the house to ensure it sells quickly and at a fair price. \n",
